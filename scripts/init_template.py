"""Substitute this template's {{PLACEHOLDER}} tokens with a repo's real values.

Run once, by /init-template, on a freshly-instantiated template. Given a JSON
file of token -> value, this rewrites every eligible file in the repo, leaves
the deferred tokens alone, and refuses to touch the three trees whose {{TOKEN}}
strings are load-bearing fixtures rather than placeholders.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Initialisation used to be a bash loop pasted into .claude/skills/init-template/
SKILL.md. It excluded tests/, scripts/ and .claude/ with a post-filter:

    grep -rln '{{[A-Z_]\\+}}' . | grep -vE '^\\./(\\.git|\\.claude|tests|scripts)/'

That assumes `grep -rln` prefixes its output with `./`. It does not always. On
a build that emits `tests/foo.py`, the anchored pattern matches nothing, the
exclusion silently becomes a no-op, and sed rewrites the very fixtures the
exclusion existed to protect.

The damage is not "two tests go red" — that is merely how it was caught. The
fixture in test_placeholder_tokens_in_draft_fences_are_never_emitted feeds an
assertion of the form `assert "{{" not in v`. Substitute the fixture and that
assertion passes *vacuously*: the guard against emitting a raw placeholder into
a signed, immutable nanopub stops guarding, and nothing fails. Silent-green CI
is the exact failure mode CLAUDE.md warns about for the first-run guard.

Hardening the bash (PR #28) removes that instance. It does not remove the
class. Prose shell in a skill file cannot be unit-tested, so the next silent
no-op — a quoting slip, a glob that does not match, a `set -e` that is not
there — survives just as long. Every other mechanical step in this template is
a tested Python script; initialisation is the one that runs first and mutates
every file in the repo, and it was the one with no tests at all.

So the exclusion is now a pure function with a test that a path-prefix
difference cannot defeat, and "which tokens may survive" is asserted rather
than described in a table.

WHAT IS PROTECTED, AND WHY
--------------------------
  tests/    Placeholder tokens here are *inputs* to tests that assert they are
            rejected. Substituting them destroys the test, sometimes loudly
            (a failing assert) and sometimes silently (a vacuous one).
  scripts/  Prose and fixtures about the placeholder contract, including this
            file. A script that rewrites itself mid-run is its own bug report.
  .claude/  Documents the token system; the tokens are the subject matter.

WHICH TOKENS MAY SURVIVE
------------------------
  deferred      ZENODO_DOI, ZENODO_VERSION_DOI, SWHID — minted at release and
                recorded by .github/workflows/release-identifiers.yml.
  doc examples  TOKEN, PLACEHOLDER — literal illustrations in docs/ prose.
  opt-in        anything passed via --allow-deferred, for a value that does not
                exist yet (e.g. PAPER_DOI when the paper is unsubmitted).

Everything else surviving a run is a genuine miss and `--check` exits nonzero.
Leaving a token in place is safe by construction: build_chain_draft.py's
_clean() rejects any value containing "{{", so a deferred token cannot reach a
signed nanopub.

Idempotent: re-running with the same values rewrites the same bytes.
